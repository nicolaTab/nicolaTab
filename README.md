### 🌍 About Me
I'm Nicola, a recent AI engineering graduate from CY Tech (France), currently living in France with dreams of working in California someday! I’m passionate about all things AI and data science, and I'm always excited to take on new challenges. My journey so far has been all about exploring AI, machine learning, and finding smart solutions. I love diving deep into data and building systems that can make a difference.

- 📊 **Specialties**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing
- 🌱 **Currently Learning**: All the tricks in the AI/ML book!
- 💼 **Career Goal**: Join a dynamic tech company (ideally 100% remote) where I can push my AI skills to the next level.

### 💼 Professional Journey
I’ve completed a six-month internship at Sopra Steria, where I worked on automating email notifications for time-tracking systems (CRA and Jira) using Java and Spring Boot. It was an incredible experience where I learned how to integrate systems efficiently, communicate effectively, and work in a team of experts.

### 💡 Fun Facts
- 🧠 I've worked on exciting projects like toxic content detection, anomaly detection in accounting, and retina binary classification for eye disease detection using CNNs.
- 🎬 Huge fan of Disney movies and Disneyland! ✨
- 🚗 I’m also a bit of a car enthusiast and enjoy the thrill of driving (especially automatics).
- 🎻 When I'm not coding, you might find me playing violin, swimming, or going for a run.
